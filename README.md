# [Trip Owls](https://tripowls.herokuapp.com/)

An app to help solo travellers to find a Trip Pal(Owl), by creating profiles, and also travel intent listings, to see if others would like to join them on their holiday and maybe help plan it out.

### Full-stack web app

| Created using Ruby and Ruby Gems, SQL, CSS & HTML. Started with wireframes and user stories to map out the user flow and requirements. Hosted on Heroku at https://tripowls.herokuapp.com/. First I worked on the pages and log-in/log-out feature. From there creating and editing user profiles. Creating new 'Trips' was an important function, each Trip can be created, viewed, edited or even deleted. Optional was the Search engine to look for other 'Trip Owls' to travel with. I have yet to get the search working correctly. |
